    <h1 id="ArtiWord" class="media-heading">Philippine Military Academy a.k.a. PMA</h1>

<p id="ArtiWord">The Philippine Military Academy (PMA) is the premier military institution of the country and is the training ground for future officers of the Armed Forces of the Phillippines. It's mission is:

"To instruct, train, and develop the cadets so that they will possess the character, the broad and basic military skills, and the education essential to the pursuit of a progressive military career."

In 1950, the Academy was transferred to a sprawling 373-hectare compound in Loakan which is ten kilometers south of downtown Baguio City. Here it found its permanent home in a fort named after the young hero of the battle of Tirad Pass, Gen. Gregorio Del Pilar.

The PMA site was developed into an ideal military training institution with facilities and infrastructure required of a growing military institution. It's rigid and unique 4-year curriculum has been designed to fit the specific needs of the major branches of service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Just like military academies in the United States, female cadets have also been accepted by PMA since 1993.</p>


  <p id="ArtiWord">Fort Del Pilar is one of the most visited and photographed places in Baguio City. Local and foreign tourists visiting the city always make the Academy an important part of their itinerary. It is one place one must not miss to see when visiting the summer capital. The fort is usually open to visitors during the daylight hours seven days a week. A camera is a must to have when visiting the Academy especially during most Saturday mornings when the cadet corps undergo their outdoor inspection in ranks. A parade and review at Borromeo Field follows the inspection. It is here where you will witness the marching precision of the Cadet Corps of the Armed Forces of The Philippines.</p>
